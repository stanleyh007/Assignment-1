Simple DB with Hashmap-based Index

## Prerequisites
Because I built this simple database in Java. You need to have the JDK installed on your machine in order to run this project that can be done from here.

## How to use
You build the project and get an executable you can run using Java -jar "filename" or you run the main class in IDEA.

## Notice
Data in the database is hardcoded and application dose not have a insert or update metode, which can read the input from consolo.
